## E-Commerce Frontend

This is the frontend of an e-commerce platform built with **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. It connects to the backend to provide a seamless user experience for browsing products, adding items to a cart, managing orders, and handling payments using Stripe.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Login and register functionality with Firebase or custom authentication.
- **Product Display**: Browse and view detailed information about products.
- **Cart Management**: Add, remove, and update items in the cart.
- **Order Processing**: Place orders and view order history.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payments handled through Stripe.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize sales and order data using Chart.js.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Show toast notifications for real-time feedback on actions like adding items to cart, placing orders, etc.
- **Responsive UI**: Responsive design using **Sass** for a modern, mobile-friendly interface.
- **Image Upload**: Admin can upload images to `Cloudinary` directly from the application. Images are stored securely in the cloud, ensuring scalability and easy access.

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for better development experience and fewer runtime errors.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For managing the application’s state with ease.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing between different pages.
- **Axios**: For making API requests to interact with the backend.
- **Stripe**: For integrating secure payment processing.
- **Chart.js**: For creating dynamic data visualizations.
- **Sass**: CSS preprocessor to write clean, maintainable styles.
- **Firebase**: For authentication or other real-time services (optional).
- **Moment.js**: For easy date manipulation and formatting.
- **6pp**: useFetchData is a powerful custom React hook for fetching data from an API. It provides a simple and efficient way to fetch data, handle loading and error states for improved performance.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.
- Backend setup and running (e.g., the [eCommerce Backend](#)).
- Stripe account for payment handling .

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-frontend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
    cd ecommerce-frontend
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Create a .env file and add the following variables:
    ```bash
   VITE_FIREBASE_KEY= 
   VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN= 
   VITE_PROJECT_ID=
   VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET= 
   VITE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID= 
   VITE_APP_ID= 
   VITE_SERVER= 
   VITE_STRIPE_KEY=
    ```

5. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
     ```   

## API Integration
The frontend communicates with the backend to fetch data, submit forms, and handle user authentication. Key integration points include:

- User Authentication: Communicates with Firebase or a custom backend API.

- Product Data: Fetches product details from the backend via API endpoints.

- Order Management: Sends order details to the backend, where they are processed.

- Payment Integration: Uses the Stripe API to process payments securely.

## Key API Endpoints

- GET /api/products: Fetches the list of available products.

- POST /api/users/register: Registers a new user.

- POST /api/orders: Creates a new order after successful payment.

- GET /api/users/profile: Retrieves the logged-in user's profile.
